public class Palindrome{

	//todo: Create a method isPalindrome which takes a String as input and returns true if it is a palindrome and false otherwise.
	//A palindrome is a word which can be read backwards and forwards in the same way., e.g. 'hannah'.
	//Ignore upper and lower case. 'Hannah' is a palindrome, too.
	//Ignore also spaces. 'Taco cat' is a valid palindrome.
